### The Big Idea: Self-Correcting Compute for Smarter, Cheaper AI
In today's AI world, computations like training models can waste massive energy on error corrections—driving up costs and slowing innovation. Base-12 changes that with a breakthrough self-correcting architecture inspired by harmonic math. It bounds errors automatically, reduces energy use by up to 30% (based on early tests), and makes AI faster and more reliable. 

Think: Fewer data center bills, greener tech, and a competitive edge in AI/ML. This demo shows it in action on a simple calculation—imagine scaling this to full models!

# Problem Section
with st.expander("The Problem: Why Traditional Compute Fails"):
    st.markdown("""
    - **Error Drift**: In long computations (e.g., dot products in neural nets), tiny errors build up, requiring expensive fixes.
    - **Energy Waste**: Billions spent on power for retries and high-precision hardware.
    - **Market Opportunity**: AI compute market is $100B+ and growing—efficiency wins big.

# Solution Section
with st.expander("Our Solution: Base-12 Self-Correction"):
    st.markdown("""
    - Uses base-12 math for natural error cancellation (e.g., fractions like 1/3 terminate cleanly).
    - Automatic 'renormalization' every 12 steps keeps drift bounded with minimal overhead.
    - Recursive: Works from small ops to full pipelines—patent-pending tech for middleware and hardware.
    - Benefits: Lower energy per correct result, bounded accuracy, scalable for AI training.
